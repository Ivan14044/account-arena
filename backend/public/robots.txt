# Block old shadow SEO routes if they still exist physically or via rewrite, though we handle them via controller now.
# But generally we want bots to crawl the main site.
# Redirects will handle the transition, so we don't strictly need to Disallow them if we want link juice to flow, 
# but we want to encourage crawling the new URLs. 
# Since we are doing 301 redirects, we can Allow them so bots see the redirect.
